# Rotating Machine Predictive Maintenance Using Classification Machine Learning.
* Built ML model to predict failure and failure type for rotating machine based on process data and machine specification.
* Performed data cleaning, feature engineering to prepare it for classification machine learning application.
* The imbalanced dataset is solved through the usage of Undersampling (NearMiss) and Oversampling (SMOTE).
